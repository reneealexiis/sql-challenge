# sql-challenge

Hello! 

You may find my document assignments in the sql-challenge folder. You may retrieve the documents by navigating through "EmployeeSQL" and "data".

My table schemas are in the "schemas.sql", my queries are in the "queries.sql" and ERD image file is called "Pewlett_Hackard_ERC.png". 

I did not work with any colleagues on the assignment. I did seek some assistance with a tutoring session to help navigate through primary and foreign keys. I used the XPert AI Assistant to help writing the script for my queries. 

Thank you!
