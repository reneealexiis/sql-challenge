# sql-challenge

# Project Overview
In this project I have been tasked with performing a research project about people in the company “Pewlett Hackard”. I conducted a research project about those employed during the 1980’s and 1990’s using only 6 files that were remaining of the employee database. 
I successfully performed data modeling, data engineering and data analysis to answer specific questions about the data. 

## Analysis of Findings 
May be found in the "queries.sql" document. 

### Instructions to Final Work 
You may find my document assignments in the sql-challenge folder. You may retrieve the documents by navigating through "EmployeeSQL" and "data".
My table schemas are in the "schemasoriginal.sql", my queries are in the "queries.sql" and ERD image file is called "Pewlett_Hackard_ERC.png". 
I did not work with any colleagues on the assignment. I did seek some assistance with a tutoring session to help navigate through primary and foreign keys. I used the XPert AI Assistant to help writing the script for my queries. 

Thank you!
